# Who wrote it 

Who wrote is a quiz game about answering who wrote the famous quotes. Is it Taylor Swift, this generation's best singwriter or is it William Shakespeare the worlds most known author. A world expert on William Shakespeare has compared Taylor Swift to some of history’s greatest writers and said she is a “real poet”.

Having sold more than 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the bestselling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums with more than 1 million copies sold in the US. and just like Shakespeare’s sonnets as exquisite poems, Swift's work also reflective of their time and culture. That is why a lot of university have started teaching Swift's words, universities in New York and Syndey to name a few. 

I felt the need to do this game after i failed so badly playing a game that inspired my work [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/abbyyelizabethh/is-this-a-taylor-swift-lyric-or-a-line-from-willia-2akie1flv1)
